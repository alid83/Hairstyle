### **For Barbers ✂️**  
1. **Sign Up/Login** – Barbers create an account or log in to their dashboard.
Barbers will sign up or log in just like a regular user.After logging in, the system will recognize the user as a barber based on their account type or role assigned during registration.

2. **Set Availability** – Define working hours and available time slots.
